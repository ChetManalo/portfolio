# Portfolio
This is my portfolio site where I'll showcase the projects I've created and update it as my skills grow. I designed it with a desktop-like interface as a fun and challenging way to push myself. Currently, you can move windows, close them, and open them by clicking on icons, just like on a real desktop. In the future, I'd like to enhance this project by making it even closer to an actual desktop experience.

## Tech
- Vite + React
- TypeScript
- SCSS
- Netlify (Hosting)

## Acknowledgments
I want to make sure to give credit where it's due!

- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)  
This is where all of the icons on the portfolio window came from.

- [Hero Patterns](https://heropatterns.com/)  
The backgrounds on the about, projects, and skills page came from here.

I was having some trouble implementing a theme toggle, but then I came across this great article that helped a ton.
